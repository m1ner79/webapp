# Webapp
A Flask-based Webapp with Jinja2.

## Requirements:
I need to build a multi-page webapp using Flask/Jinja2 which provides details about me, my interests, and the computing technologies I like.  
### The following pages are required:
- A home page providing links to the various sections of my website.•A personal page providing all the usual details.
- A CV page providing details of interest to potential employers.
- A computing technologies page which has at least 3 sub-pages providing details on my favourite computing technologies.
- An interests page which provides details on your interests outside of my course and computers.
I need to provide a mechanism which lets a visitor to my site return to my home page from any other page on my site.  Where necessary, provide links to external sites on the web (as needed).  External links need to open in a new tab. My site is to include a small form which lets visitors post a short message.  Two pieces of information should be posted: my visitors’ email address as well as their message.  These data are to be stored on my server in a file called comments.txt.
